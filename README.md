# Machine Learning Progress

Welcome to my Machine Learning journey repository! This project serves as a comprehensive record of my progress, experiments, and implementations as I delve into the world of ML.

## Current Status

At present, the repository features several personal projects and implementations of Machine Learning algorithms across different domains, from Regression to SVM.

### Implemented Algorithms:

#### 📈 Regression

- **Simple Linear Regression**: The foundation of predictive modeling.
- **Linear Regression**: Multi-variable relationships and optimizations.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Handling non-linear data patterns.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net.

#### 🎯 Classification

- **Logistic Regression**: Binary and multi-class classification.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Instance-based learning.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Margin-based classification and regression.

#### 🛠️ Preprocessing & Validation

- **Feature Engineering**: Handling outliers, missing data, and categorical encoding.
- **Cross Validation**: Robust model evaluation and K-Fold strategies.
- **Grid Search**: Hyperparameter tuning and optimization.

## Future Roadmap

This journey continues! Upcoming focus areas include:

- [ ] **Tree-based Models**: Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Boosting.
- [ ] **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, and PCA.
- [ ] **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text Vectorization and Naive Bayes.
- [ ] **Neural Networks & Deep Learning**: Building and training complex models.
