# Machine Learning Progress

Welcome to my Machine Learning journey repository! This project serves as a comprehensive record of my progress, experiments, and implementations as I delve into the world of ML.

## Current Status

At present, the repository focuses on **Regression** algorithms. I have implemented various regression models to understand their underlying mechanics and applications.

### Implemented Algorithms:
*   **Simple Linear Regression**: The foundation of predictive modeling.
*   **Linear Regression**: Multi-variable relationships and optimizations.
*   **Polynomial Regression**: Handling non-linear data patterns.
*   **Regularization Techniques**:
    *   Lasso Regression (L1)
    *   Ridge Regression (L2)
    *   Elastic Net

## Future Roadmap

This is just the beginning. I plan to expand this repository with a wide range of other Machine Learning algorithms and models, including but not limited to:

- [ ] **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM.
- [ ] **Tree-based Models**: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Boosted Trees (XGBoost, AdaBoost).
- [ ] **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, PCA.
- [ ] **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Naive Bayes, Text Vectorization.
- [ ] **Neural Networks & Deep Learning**: Building and training complex models.

*This repository is a work in progress and will be updated regularly as I learn and implement new concepts.*
